# E-commerce API

A backend API for an e-commerce platform built with Go. This project provides essential features for running an online store, including user authentication, product management, and order processing.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
*   **Admin Seeding:** Automatic creation of an admin user on startup from environment variables.
*   **RESTful API:** A clean and organized API structure.
*   **Configuration-driven:** Easy setup using environment variables.
*   **Email Integration:** Ready for integrating with an email service for notifications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   [Go](https://golang.org/)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
*   JWT for Authentication

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18 or higher)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Asura409/Ecommerce-api.git
    cd Ecommerce-api
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and fill in your specific configuration details, such as your database credentials and a strong JWT secret.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will download the necessary Go modules.
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**
    Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running. Connect to it and create the database you specified in the `DATABASE_DSN` variable in your `.env` file.

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
    The API server should now be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `3001`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables stored in a `.env` file.
